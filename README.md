The `rosario` package provides tools to quantify and visualize temporal
niche overlap using Pianka and Czekanowski indices, and to simulate null
models with the ROSARIO algorithm (Castro-Arellano et al. 2010).

## Installation

You can install the development version of rosario from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# Install devtools if you don't have it
install.packages("devtools")

# Install rosario from GitHub
devtools::install_github("alrobles/rosario")
```

You can also get the official release version from CRAN

``` r
install.packages("rosario")
```
